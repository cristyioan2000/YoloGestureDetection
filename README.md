# YoloGestureDetection

## This project contains a trained hand model for specific hand gestures and facial recognition.

### This model was trained with darknet from https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet
The dataset is selfmade following some parameters whom were observed during the creation of previous datasets.
### The model has very high accuracy raiting.
Some results will be posted in the following month.
### The training took place on a Google Cloud Ubuntu VM with a Tesla K80 GPU.
So CUDA was involved for the training phase.

Come back on 25.05.2019 !

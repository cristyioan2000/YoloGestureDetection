# YoloGestureDetection

## This project contains a trained hand model for specific hand gestures and facial recognition.

### This model was trained using darknet https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet


### The training took place on a Google Cloud Ubuntu VM with a Tesla K80 GPU.
So CUDA was involved for the training phase.

## DATASET
The dataset is selfmade following some parameters whom were observed during the creation of previous datasets.
The script used for sampels gathering is here https://github.com/cristyioan2000/yolo_format_gen .


## Training
The model was trained in multiple sessiosn  on google colab. Time trained: several days, nearly a weeek.
